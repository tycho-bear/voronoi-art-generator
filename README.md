# Voronoi Art Generator


## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to apply [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
in an artistic manner. The goal is to create a visually pleasing representation of an input image. Users can click on the canvas to create points, and this will generate edges and partition the plane into different regions.

The application also supports overlaying Voronoi diagrams on images and applying a "stained glass" effect to fill each cell with the average color of the pixels within it.
